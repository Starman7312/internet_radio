An internet-based radio player, using the VLC framework to stream the radio

Setup:  
    • Install VLC media player (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)  
    • May already be installed in some OS's (e.g. Linux)

    • Windows:
        • Install the vlc python library via this command line: pip install python-vlc
    • Linux or other similar OS:
        • Install the vlc python library via this command line: sudo apt-install python3-vlc

• Then just run the code file named radio.py and you should be up and running
  
  Comes with a few radio stations pre-installed (BBC etc.), but you can add more  
  Pages such as this are great for finding the radio stations URL's: https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_BBC_radio_stream_URLs  
  Or you can often get them directly from the station or a search for something like: radio stream URL for StationXXXX
